# Windows

#### Windows setup & scripts

Made for version 10.

To be able to execute scripts: open PowerShell (Start menu -> type `Windows PowerShell`) as an administrator and execute:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

BitLocker is not available on the Home version so it is recommended to install Pro or above.
