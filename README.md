#### Windows setup & scripts

Made for version 10. BitLocker is not available on the Home version so it is recommended to install Pro or above.

To be able to execute scripts: open PowerShell (Start menu -> type `Windows PowerShell`) as an administrator and execute:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
