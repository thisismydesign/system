#### Windows setup & scripts

Made for version 10. BitLocker is not available on the Home version so it is recommended to install Pro or above.

To be able to execute scripts: open PowerShell (Start menu -> type `Windows PowerShell`) as an administrator and execute:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

Manual steps:
- Turn on BitLocker on C:
- Turn on Dark mode
- Adjust power, sleep and energy settings
